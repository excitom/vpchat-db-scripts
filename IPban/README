When signalServer runs from a CGI, it is run by user 'nobody'.
It can't send the HUP signal to vpusers.exe since vpusers is 
run by user 'vplaces'.

signalServer is a program compiled from signalServer.c, that sends
the HUP. It must run with setUID privilege (chmod +s) so that
when invoked from a CGI it will switch to user 'vplaces'.

I used to use signalServer.pl for this purpose, but either Perl or
Solaris has gotten more strict -- I can't get it to actually 
switch to vplaces any more when run from a CGI. So, I had to resort
to a C program.

BE SURE signalServer HAS SETUID PRIVILEGE OR THE CGI's WON'T WORK
