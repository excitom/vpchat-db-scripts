Subject: Changes to the User-Created Rooms list

Hi -

We're making some changes in the Halsoft VP Chat user-created rooms list.

A couple of months ago we started requiring that all new listings must 
be http://members.vpchat.com web pages. This didn't affect exising listings.

The reason for this is because we promise that Halsoft VP chat is free
of advertising, and many people were complaining when they clicked links
in our chat rooms list and saw lots of pop-ups and banners.

You get a free http://members.vpchat.com web page for each of the names
in your account, with 10Mb of storage and 2Gb of bandwidth per month. Also
you can log into your account at vpchat.com, click on "my web site" and
juggle the storage space and bandwidth among your pages. For example, if you
need more space for a page and aren't using one of your other pages, you can
add the unused space to the page that needs it.

We're now ready to make the list contain member pages exclusively. On May 
5th we'll be removing any listings that are not Halsoft member pages.

You'll still be able to have external links on your member page, of course.

Thanks in advance for your cooperation and patience. These changes will 
allow us to have a better user-created room list.

You may have your own domain, or a page that doesn't have ads because you
are paying extra for it, so you would like to keep that page in the list.
However, to be fair to everyone, we must apply the rules equally to all.
